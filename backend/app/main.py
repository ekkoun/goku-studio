goku-studio — Studio domain API service.

Owns: agent_definitions, workflows, tools, MCP servers, knowledge,
      external_memory_sources, IRA, improvement_proposals, prompt_experiments.

Does NOT own: tasks, conversations, approvals, users, tenants, channels.
Core runtime (task execution, ReAct loop) lives in goku-core.

During the monorepo transition period, Studio is also mounted inside the
monorepo's main.py (app/routers/studio). This standalone main.py is used
only when Studio is deployed as a separate service.
